# Unexpected Array Key Modification in PHP Function

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a PHP function that unexpectedly modifies array keys. The function `processData()` is intended to process an array, but due to a coding error, it alters the array keys in an unexpected way.  The issue is detailed in the `bug.php` file, and a corrected version is provided in `bugSolution.php`.

## Bug Description
The original `processData()` function contains a flaw that unintentionally removes array keys during the processing. This results in an inconsistent and unexpected output that differs from the expected result.

## Solution
The corrected `processData()` function in `bugSolution.php` addresses this issue. The solution demonstrates how to handle array manipulations correctly to ensure that array keys are not inadvertently removed or modified unexpectedly. The modifications involve careful array key handling and avoidance of actions that unintentionally impact array structures.
